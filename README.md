## Welcome, Young Wizard!

This folder serves as the home for *Hero's Quest*, my final project for the [Caribbean Science Foundation's Caribbean Coding Workshop](caribbeanscience.org/coding-workshop/) CCW:002 course.  

**Concept:** 
You are a young wizard, freshly graduated from the Wizarding Citadel, and have returned to your home to find an evil sorcerer has taken over your village.  Defeat his minions on each level to move to the next stage.  At the final level, you will battle the sorcerer himself to free your family and friends from his control.

Gameplay uses W A S D keys for Up, Left, Down, and Right movement, respectively.  You can replenish your health by collecting the red potion.

Post graduation, the game development remains in progress.  Upgrades include better background graphics, new levels, and transitions between levels, to name a few.
